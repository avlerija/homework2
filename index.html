                Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink
                that is made from this plant. ... The drink is made from
                the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans.
                Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink
                in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called
                caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.
                There are four primary types of coffee beans: Arabica (Coffee arabica),
                Robusta (Coffee caniphora), Liberica (Coffee liberica),
                and Excelsa (Coffee liberica var. dewevrei).

            <p> Arabica is the most common (and certainly most heavily marketed)
                type of coffee in North America.
                That’s because it actually has a sweeter, more delicate
                flavor and the coffee itself tends to be less acidic. </p>
            <p> Robusta coffee beans are second on the list and the most
                popular in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Its name
                does this bean justice, as it is known for its strong
                and often harsh flavor profile. Robusta coffees
                have extremely high levels of caffeine. </p>
            <p>Liberica coffee beans are a rare treat. They’re grown in very
                specific climates with production being far too scarce for
                farmers to scale their operations to truly satisfy a global
                marketplace. Even still, the beans are considered a pleasant
                surprise. Many who’ve tried the coffee liken the aroma to fruit
                and flowers and describe the flavor as having a somewhat “woody” taste.</p>
            <p>Excelsa is technically a member of the Liberica family, but its
                species is actually incredibly distinct. Like the Liberica coffee
                described above, Excelsa is grown primarily in Southeast Asia and
                represents only a small fraction of the world’s coffee production.
                Excelsa does boast a tart, fruitier flavor and is known for showing
                attributes of both light and dark roast coffees to create a unique
                profile that is frequently sought out by coffee enthusiasts.</p>
